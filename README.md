# Cloth-size-prediction-model
have you ever wondered how do we get suggested size for the clothes that we purchase on amazon, flipkart or any online shopping platform? well I have. so I wanted to use machine learning algorithms to do this job for me.

I just created a model that can predict your matching size based on the weight, age and height.
the dataset has been collected from kaggle for analysis.
this model can be deployed or integrated into an app or website.


note: the accuracy score is not up to the mark for this model but we can improve it later. flow must be same for all the algorithms we could use.
